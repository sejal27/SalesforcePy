A Salesforce.com [Open Source contribution](https://opensource.salesforce.com/).

SalesforcePy is an absurdly simple package for making Salesforce Rest API calls. We created this package so you can:

+ Have a Salesforce client that is reusable, minimalistic, and pythonic
+ Use interfaces that are closely knit to the Salesforce Rest API service specification

Please check out the full documentation on [Read the Docs](https://salesforcepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

With time, we plan to add more support for the Salesforce API extended family, including Chatter, Analytics, Wave, Tooling, Bulk, Metadata, and more. Want to help? [Open to all!](https://salesforcepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribute.html)
